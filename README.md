# GSS
_Great Style Sequence_

CSS can be a huge mess (especially when I make it) so this will not only butify the CSS but it will put it in the same order as the tags in a html and it wil categorise it inside every CSS-declaration thing! Amazing

I still need to fix the order list but this kinda works for now :D

Things to bugfix:

- @keyframes
- URLs inside @import
