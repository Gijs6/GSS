# GSS
_Great Style Sequence_

CSS can be a huge mess (especially when I make it) so this will not only butify the CSS but it will put it in the same order as the tags in a html and it wil categorise it inside every CSS-declaration thing! Amazing

_I just typed this so I do not forget the idea ðŸ™ƒ_; https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/all-properties.en.html

## To do

- [x] Add support for :hover
- [ ] If item can't be found in HTML, maybe try to find a other element that is referenced in the selector (such as a + for the sibling selector and stuff)
- [ ] Fix CSS-order-data-list
- [ ] Support for :root, html, @import, @media, @keyframes, webkit pseudo stuff, and things with vars
